## What is Shell?
Shell is a command line interface that takes command from the keyboard and
gives them to the OS to perform.

### About this project
This project is a simple version of the linux shell made for Alx SE Program as part of the low-level programming curriculum.

## Essential Functionalities of the Simple Shell:
> Displays a prompt and waits for user input.\
> Runs all commands of type "executable program" (ls and /bin/ls).\
> Runs the following build_in commands: **exit**, **env**, **setenv** and **unsetenv**.\
> Handles commands with arguments.\
> Handles the PATH global variable.\
> Handles The EOF (End Of File) condition.\
> Handles the Ctrl + C signal -> It doesn't exit the shell
